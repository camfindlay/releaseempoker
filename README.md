# Creative Commons Release 'em poker
An educational card game loosely based on Texas Hold'em poker teaching Creative Commons licensing.

 * Players: 6-8 per table
 * Play time: 45 mins - 1 hours
 * Deck of playing cards
  
Each of the 4 CC license elements replace the suits on a standard deck of playing cards.
 * BY (Spades)
 * SA (Hearts)
 * ND (Diamonds)
 * NC (Clubs)
 * CC0/Public domain (Joker)

## Objective 
 * Each players goal is to use the cards containing license elements to create the most useful Creative Commons license for the given scenario. 
 * Players can use higher card numbers to try and win the hand. 
 * The license that is both correct and worth the most points wins the hand.
 * If only one player has the correct license, they win the hand (and get a point - you could use counters or similar to track points).

## Setting up
 1. Select a dealer.
 2. Dealer shuffles the cards and deals 2 cards per player and puts the scenario cards face up on the table.
 3. The dealer reads out the face up scenario to the players.
 4. Decide which player takes their turn first (we suggest who ever most recently reused someone with a Creative Commons licence).
 5. There are 4 rounds of play per hand of Release 'em poker.
 
## Playing 
### Round 1 (Pre-flop) 
  1. Each player takes turn checking the cards in their hand to see if they can combine the elements on the cards to make a known Creative Commons license for the scenario. Don't show the other players if they can!
  2. During their turn, the player can discard 1 or 2 of the cards in their hand and draw new ones on each turn in order to try to:
   * get the cards needed to make a license or;
   * try to get higher numbered versions of the licence elements (in the final round it's the player with the highest numbered correct license that wins the hand).
  3. If a player wants to sit out of the hand they can say "Fold" and put their cards face down on the table.
  4. If a player has no further actions to do in their turn that can say "Check" to pass the turn on to the next player to their left.
  5. Once all players have had a turn in the round the dealer will move on to Round 2.

### Round 2 (The flop)
  1. The dealer will discard the top card from the deck of cards and deal the next 3 cards face up on the table in a row.
  2. Players then carry out their turn in the same way as round 1, and can now use both the cards in their hand AND the shared cards on the table (referred to as the "community cards") to create a Creative Commons license.
  3. The player can discard and redraw, fold or check just as in Round 1.
  4. Once all players have completed Round 2, the dealer will move to round 3.
  
### Round 3 (The turn)
 1.The dealer will discard the top card from the deck of cards and deal 1 more card face up on the table into the row of existing face up community cards.
 2. Players take their turn as set out in Round 2 above.
  
### Round 4 (The river)
 1. This is the final round for the hand of Release 'em poker.
 2. The dealer will discard the top card from the deck of cards and deal 1 more card face up on the table into the row of existing face up community cards.
 3. Players take their turn as set out in Round 2 above.
 4. If a player cannot make a license, then should fold their hand.
 5. Once all remaining players have had their turn, each player will then show their hand, that is, reveal the licence they think is correct.
 6. Each player should tell the group why they think the license is the best choice and how it applies to the scenario.
 7. The dealer will flip the scenario card over to reveal the correct answer/s (sometimes there may be more than 1 correct license).
 8. The player with the correct license and the highest value cards wins the hand (and gets a point).
 
### Next hand
 1. The dealer collects in all the cards used during the hand into the deck of cards, shuffles and repeats the Setting up proces from above.
 2. Play though until all the Scenario cards are licensed or you run out of time.
 3. The person with the most won hands/points is the winner... and when we open license work for reuse using Creative Commons... we're all winners :)

## Example hand of Release 'em poker
### Scenario
Bob is a political cartoonist, he likes to get his message out by others sharing his cartoons on their facebook timelines, however he wants to reserve his rights to publish his cartoons in paid magazines and wants to ensure when shared, others retain his cartoons in their original form. 

**What license should Bob release 'em under?**

### Round 1: Pre-flop
Person to left of the dealer begins the game. Dealer deals 2 cards to each player.
Decide which license to release the work under and why.
Players may discard 1 or both cards if needed. 
After all players have completed above move to turn 2.

### Round 2: The flop
Dealer deals out 3 cards face up in the middle of the table.
Players should use the cards in their hand and those on the board to construct the preferred licence.
Remember: You want to construct the highest value licence possible.

For example:
	A Queen BY/Jack ND/King NC hand beats a 2 BY/Jack ND/10 NC hand.
Each player can choose to discard 1 or both cards in their hand to try and get a better one.
Once all players complete their turn, move to turn 3.

### Round 3: The turn
Dealer deals another 1 card face up on on the table next to the others.
Players have another round of discard and draw.
Once all players complete their turn, move to turn 4.

### Round 4: The river
Dealer deals 1 card face up on on the table next to the others.
Players have a final round of discard and draw.
Once all have completed the turn, each player shows their licence
Some players may not have been able to make a license, they FOLD and can discuss what licence they wanted to make.
Other players may make up a licence and the player with the highest scoring licence wins that round (a point to them!).
